## Archive Mode (Logistics Map)

- Camps can be archived from the main map. Archiving hides the camp and all its areas/items from all pages (map, camps, analytics, tracking).
- Toggle "Archive Mode" in the map to view archived camps in read-only mode.
- In Archive Mode, you can:
  - Unarchive a camp (return it to normal data)
  - Permanently delete a camp (irreversible; removes camp, areas, items, and uploaded files)
- Editing (draw, edit, delete areas/camps) is disabled in Archive Mode.
